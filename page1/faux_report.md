### 2. Media Framing Reinforces Appetite Suppression Narrative

Over the last 6 months, mainstream media outlets have amplified the appetite-reducing narrative of GLP-1s. Over 60 articles in top-tier outlets (WSJ, NYT, Axios, Wired, etc.) mention the impact of GLP-1 drugs on consumer food habits.

- "The $100 Billion Snack Industry Is Eyeing a Shrinking Stomach" — Wall Street Journal headline, April 2025  
- "Why Big Food Is Worried About Ozempic" — Axios, March 2025

News content consistently links GLP-1s to:
- Reduced emotional eating  
- Declining consumption of impulse snacks  
- New health norms among Millennials and Gen Z  

### 3. Implications for Snack Categories
